# PokeMath
## 2016 Java Project by Akhil P and Sidd R
### PokeMath is a game modelled after the classic Pokemon games, except with basic math involved. There is a different geometry concept based on which Pokemon is chosen and to attack the corresponding geometry question needs to be answered
#### This was Akhil and I's first large scale project, so keep that in mind while looking at our cluttered/disorganized code.

#### If you would like to play this game (for whatever reason), download all the files and run PokeTest.java
